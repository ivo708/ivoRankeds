# ivoRankeds

A Fabric 1.16.9 Minecraft mod that brings a fully-featured ranked battle system for Cobblemon, complete with LuckPerms rank compatibility and battle management tools.

- **Cobblemon Ranked Challenges**  
  Instead of a simple queue, players issue a challenge request to a specific opponent. The target can accept or decline.

- **ELO & Rank-Based Scoring**  
  Win or lose, your ELO change depends on both your current rating and your opponent’s rank. Upsets net you more points; defeats against higher-ranked foes cost less.

- **Opponent Team Preview**  
  Before accepting a challenge, you can view the challenger’s Cobblemon team to plan your strategy.

- **Custom Player Ranks**  
  Automatically sync Cobblemon ladder ranks with LuckPerms groups, or manage leaderboard roles manually.
